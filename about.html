                      The biological function of a flower is to affect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the 
                      union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing or allow selfing. Some flowers produce 
                      diaspores without fertilization. Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. 
                      Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer
                      of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.</p>
